# pi-access-system

pi-access-system is the result of investigating and developing an access system capable of validating the use of face mask, a valid body temperature and capturing the result of a survey on how the people that wan to cross the system have felt through the reading of a QR code.

It was made entirely using Python and the neural network was trained using the data samples and code from the tutorial: [COVID-19: Face Mask Detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning
](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/) and adapted to work with all the different modules of the system.
